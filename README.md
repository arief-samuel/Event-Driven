### Contents
- Create the .NET Core Microservices and Exchange Messages
- Implement the Transactional Outbox Pattern
- (Optional) Test the Implementation
- Add Publisher Notify, Acknowledgments, and Resilient Message Handling
- Final Thoughts and Outlook

>You added the outbox pattern to your event-driven architecture and made it more resilient.
You would have to adjust the code to use it in a production environment: Clean up the code and apply security best practices. Apply .NET Core design patterns, error handling, etc. You should also optimize the publisher acknowledgments and use a BackgroundService in the post service.
